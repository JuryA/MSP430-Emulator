MSP430-Emulator
===============
The first project goal is to provide a software model of the MSP430 instruction set complete with an interactive debugger. After that, other devices on the chip may be implemented providing a simulated interface for serial communication, and general pin and electronics testing with the 430 using openGL to create a graphics interface for virtual breadboarding.
